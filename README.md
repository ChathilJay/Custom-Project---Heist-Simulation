# Custom-Project---Heist-Simulation

Project Description

In this Project we aim to build a simulated Heist or a Robbery Scenario in a 2D graph-based environment where an Autonomous character “Agent (Thief)” will have to navigate through a set of terrains to steal an item and escape while avoiding the security agent guarding the item.
The Thief agent will be actively learning optimal strategies to avoid the Guarding agent. The Guarding agent will be a FSM which performs dynamic behaviors like patrolling, chasing and investigating. Movement throughout the terrain map will be guided through seek, wander and flee to ensure random and realistic interactions.

Learning Outcome Approach Strategy

ULO1 - Discuss and implement software development techniques to support the creation of AI behavior in games, focusing on non-obvious problem-solving approaches.
•	In this project we aim to integrate both FSM and Learn based AI to address on the navigation and path planning showcasing hybrid approach on this project

ULO2 - Understand and utilize a variety of graph and path-planning techniques.
•	We will be implementing a custom navigation graph that is built to represent the Path layout, where both the agents will be traversing.

ULO3 - Design and create realistic movements for agents using steering force models to simulate natural and responsive behavior.
•	For utilization of the behavioral pattern of the agent we will be using Seek, Flee and Wander which will guide the agent movement which create a more dynamic simulation


ULO4 - Design and develop agents capable of planning actions that require adaptive problem-solving techniques and innovative solutions.
•	We plan on using reinforcement learning to adapt decision to be based on the environment which will have outcomes based on the past interaction to finding the best times for decision.

ULO5 - Combine multiple AI techniques to develop sophisticated game AI capable of solving intricate, multi-layered problems that arise in dynamic game environments.
•	As we plan on implementing FSMs, Steering and graph-based movement , we will be integrating all these techniques into the same environment as the final output.
